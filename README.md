# Text reuse in the *Summa contra Gentiles*
This research seeks to automatically detect text reuse (verbatim and paraphrase) between the *Summa contra Gentiles* of Thomas Aquinas and a number of other works. 

The detection software used is [TRACER](http://www.etrap.eu/research/tracer). The automatically-detected reuses are evaluated against the manually-annotated (explicit) quotations in the *Index Thomisticus*, which is used as a gold standard. 
The objective is to create an "Index fontium computatus" containing true positives, false positives as well as false negatives to better understand the limitations of retrieval methods and linguistic resources for Latin.
