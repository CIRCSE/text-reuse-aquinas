# Text reuse in Thomas Aquinas
This research project seeks to automatically detect text reuse (verbatim and non-verbatim) in the works of Thomas Aquinas (Latin). 

## Goal of the project
The objective of the project is to run TRACER, a text reuse detection machine, on the corpus of Thomas Aquinas (*Corpus Thomisticum*) and to compare the automatically-detected reuses against the manually-annotated quotations present in the *Index Thomisticus Treebank (ITTB)*. False positives produced by TRACER will be of particular interest as these could contain previously unnoticed text reuse.
